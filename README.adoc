# oVirtHomeServer
An extensible virtualization server setup based on oVirt on Gluster for home use

## Overview

### Architecture
This setup uses a main server running CentOS with oVirt on Gluster, also called hyperconverged setup - see [Deploying a Single Node oVirt and Gluster Hyperconverged](https://ovirt.org/documentation/gluster-hyperconverged/chap-Single_node_hyperconverged/) for documentation.

## Installation

### Install master server
Download the latest CentOS image for x86 64bit from [Download CentOS](https://www.centos.org/download/); on a Linux system this could look like this:
```
wget -c http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/7/isos/x86_64/CentOS-7-x86_64-DVD-1908.iso
```

Now, as user `root` write the ISO image to an SD card / USB stick to boot the server from; on Linux, this could look like this:
```
# dd bs=4M status=progress if=CentOS-7-x86_64-DVD-1908.iso of=/dev/sdb
```

Boot from SD card / USB stick and press the <TAB> key at "Install CentOS" selection; add
```
inst.ks=http://raw.githubusercontent.com/joschro/ovhs/master/ovhs-ks.cfg
or easier
inst.ks=http://bit.ly/ovhs-ks
```
to the kernel command line parameters and press <ENTER>.

The kickstart process will now take place.

Next, login to your installed system and
```
[root@ovhs ~]# sh ./run_ovhs_ansible_install.sh
```

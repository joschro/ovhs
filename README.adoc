# oVirtHomeServer
An extensible virtualization server setup based on oVirt on Gluster for home use

## Overview

### Architecture
This setup uses a main server running CentOS with oVirt on Gluster, also called hyperconverged setup - see [Deploying a Single Node oVirt and Gluster Hyperconverged](https://ovirt.org/documentation/gluster-hyperconverged/chap-Single_node_hyperconverged/) for documentation.

## Installation

### Install master server
Download the latest CentOS image for x86 64bit from [Download CentOS](https://www.centos.org/download/); on a Linux system this could look like this:
```
wget -c http://isoredirect.centos.org/centos/8-stream/isos/x86_64/CentOS-Stream-8-x86_64-latest-boot.iso
```

Now, as user `root` write the ISO image to an SD card / USB stick to boot the server from; on Linux, this could look like this:
```
# dd bs=4M status=progress if=CentOS-Stream-8-x86_64-latest-boot.iso of=/dev/sdb
```

Boot from SD card / USB stick and press the <TAB> key (in case of UEFI boot: <e>) at "Install CentOS" selection; for UEFI boot enabled systems add
```
inst.ks=http://raw.githubusercontent.com/joschro/ovhs/master/ovhs-uefi-ks.cfg
or easier
inst.ks=http://bit.ly/ovhs-uefi
```
, for BIOS boot systems add respectively
```
inst.ks=http://raw.githubusercontent.com/joschro/ovhs/master/ovhs-bios-ks.cfg
or easier
inst.ks=http://bit.ly/ovhs-bios
```
to the kernel command line parameters and press <ENTER> (in case of UEFI boot: <CTRL>-x).

The kickstart process will now take place. Make sure to enter the disk encryption passphrase after the automtic reboot at the end of the installation.

Next, point your browser to

and wait until you can login using the user root and password ovhs.
